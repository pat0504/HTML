					I think this classroom looks ideal because it has a big couch where everyone can be comfortable while we have group meetings, while also having a desk in the back to collaborate one on one.

					I like this classroom because the room is about collaboration at the roundtable-esk set up along with a TV on the side (not shown in picture) to project information.
